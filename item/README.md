# Profile YAML and JS

Toggle between [Nutrition Layout](#layout=nutrition) and [Product Layout](#layout=product)

[View Profile Label JavaScript](https://github.com/ModelEarth/profile/blob/main/item/js/label.js)

TO DO: Add emissions details from [BuildingTransparency.org Products](/products/) to the [Product Layout](#layout=product).  


Our following label builder is similar to a [Nutritionix Label](/data-commons/docs/food/), but it's easier to reuse since the layout object is built from YAML by a javascript template. Here's an assist from [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/share/68ade5c5-9b05-46a8-a0da-ccd771289693). Combines Food YAML and Daily Recommended YAML to create Profile Object json.
