An example of using the Circular Flow diagram with actual data, as explained in my blog on [How to create a Flow diagram with a circular Twist](http://www.visualcinnamon.com/2015/08/stretched-chord.html)

It shows what types of educations (on the left) lead to what types of occupations (on the right) about 1.5 years after graduating. The data is based on about 18000 HBO graduates in 2014 in the Netherlands used for the [State of the State](http://www2.deloitte.com/nl/nl/pages/deloitte-analytics/articles/onderwijs-resultaten-2015-state-of-the-state.html) project
